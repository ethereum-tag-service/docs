## What is ETS?

Ethereum Tag Service (ETS) is an experimental EVM based content tagging service, aimed at Web3 developers, running in alpha/testnet phase.

In ETS, tags, content tagging & tagging data are fully composable units & services. This treatment is intended to reduce infrastructure, preserve data integrity and increase reach & engagement for the projects that consume the service.

## Getting Started

If you want to jump right in, head over to [JavaScript client quickstart](./docs/js-client-quickstart.md) or [Contract-to-contract quickstart](./docs/contract-to-contract-quickstart.md).

To learn a bit more before diving in, see [key concepts](./docs/key-concepts.md) and the [system architecture diagram](./docs/system-architecture.md/).

## Contributing

ETS is an alpha/testnet service being "as openly as possible". The core infrastructure is being developed closed source until mainnet, after which it will be released as open source software (OSS). Public participation is nevertheless is both welcome and necessary for the project to thrive.

For developers (or anyone for that matter), with bug reports, questions & feedback please use our Github [discussion forum](https://github.com/orgs/ethereum-tag-service/discussions).

We also post occasional updates to [X](https://x.com/etsxyz) and our blog [Darwins Haeckel](https://blog.ets.xyz/) if you want to stay informed.
